Elizabeth : Hello, good sir!
Edwin : Greetings, M'lady!
Edwin : What is a beauty like yourself doing in such dark place?
Elizabeth : The usual, trying to pretend that I have some meaning in this scene while the player tests this game.
Edwin : What?
Elizabeth : What?
Edwin : ...Ok, nevermind that. Should I see you off somewhere else?
Elizabeth : Thank you, but no. I like it here. However, you could anwser my question...
Elizabeth : Would you kill a baby Hitler with your bare hands?
Edwin : I think I would, that could save million of lives./I would rather talk him out of the things he did./I don't want to be a baby-killer.
Elizabeth : So you would just kill an innocent baby? I doubt that./Always going for the pacifist run, huh? It may bring you to doom./Being honest I see. Even though you are letting millions of lives die.
Elizabeth : Well, in any case, I think this is the time you drink my totally-not-magical potions and go to the dreamworld of yours.
Edwin : I drink what....?
